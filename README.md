### Introduction

This is an application that models the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

### Process 

1. Model planes taking off and landing
2. Implement traffic control to prevent planes from landing if the airport is full
3. Prevent planes from landing if there is a storm
4. Do grand finale to show the complete interaction of planes and airports.

### Status

Project complete. But the code base could do with refactoring.

### What I learnt

This project really helped in consolidating my first weeks knowledge at Makers Academy. Particularly helped in understanding the Single Responsibility Principle.
